## Our ambition

Improve the safety of FreeRTOS while maintaining its efficiency with the help of Rust programming language.

## We have already implementedâ€¦

* A unified **FFI** allowing the OS to seamlessly communicate with the C code in portable layer.
* A **doubly-linked list** using smart pointers. (It's really hard in Rust)
* A fully-functional **task scheduler** based on task priority.
* A fixed-length **queue**, with **semaphores and mutexes** built upon it.
* A set of **optionally-compiled functionalities** to help you DIY the kernel.
