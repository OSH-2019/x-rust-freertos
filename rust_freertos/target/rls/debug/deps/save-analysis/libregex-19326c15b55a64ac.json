crate provides a library for parsing, compiling, and executing regular\nexpressions. Its syntax is similar to Perl-style regular expressions, but lacks\na few features like look around and backreferences. In exchange, all searches\nexecute in linear time with respect to the size of the regular expression and\nsearch text.","sig":null,"attributes":[{"value":"deny(missing_docs)","span":{"file_name":[47,104,111,109,101,47,115,116,114,105,107,101,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,114,101,103,101,120,45,49,46,49,46,54,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":18173,"byte_end":18195,"line_start":520,"line_end":520,"column_start":1,"column_end":23}}]},{"kind":"Mod","id":{"krate":0,"index":56},"span":{"file_name":[47,104,111,109,101,47,115,116,114,105,107,101,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,114,101,103,101,120,45,49,46,49,46,54,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":22507,"byte_end":22512,"line_start":642,"line_end":642,"column_start":9,"column_end":14},"name":"bytes","qualname":"::bytes","value":"/home/strike/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/regex-1.1.6/src/lib.rs","parent":null,"children":[{"krate":0,"index":58},{"krate":0,"index":60},{"krate":0,"index":62},{"krate":0,"index":64}],"decl_id":null,"docs":"Match regular expressions on arbitrary bytes.","sig":null,"attributes":[{"value":"cfg(feature = \"use_std\")","span":{"file_name":[47,104,111,109,101,47,115,116,114,105,107,101,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,114,101,103,101,120,45,49,46,49,46,54,47,115,114,99,47,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":22471,"byte_end":22498,"line_start":641,"line_end":641,"column_start":1,"column_end":28}}]},{"kind":"Struct","id":{"krate":0,"index":186},"span":{"file_name":[47,104,111,109,101,47,115,116,114,105,107,101,47,46,99,97,114,103,111,47,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,47,115,114,99,47,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,47,114,101,103,101,120,45,49,46,49,46,54,47,115,114,99,47,99,111,109,112,105,108,101,46,114,115],"byte_start":44324,"byte_end":44332,"line_start":37,"line_end":37,"column_start":12,"column_end":20},"name":"Compiler","qualname":"::compile::Compiler","value":"Compiler {  }","parent":null,"children":[{"krate":0,"index":35},{"krate":0,"index":37},{"krate":0,"index":39},{"krate":0,"index":41},{"krate":0,"index":43},{"krate":0,"index":45},{"krate":0,"index":47},{"krate":0,"index":49}],"decl_id":null,"docs":" A compiler translates a regular expression AST to a sequence of\n instructions.
